message: "Hi there this is kind of of off topic but I was wondering if blogs use WYSIWYG editors or \r\nif you have to manually code with HTML. I'm starting a blog soon but have no coding expertise so I wanted to get guidance from someone with experience.\r\n\r\nAnny help would be enormously appreciated!"
