  Koh Samui is an ideal place for exploring yoga due to the outstanding natural
  beauty of the island. Most of Koh Samui is still considered unspoiled and
  unpolluted. Time on Koh Samui is an opportunity to relax, unwind, explore and
  focus on yourself. Enjoy the natural energy of palm trees, white sand, purple
  sunsets, turquoise waters, dense jungle, and exotic waterfalls. Despite being
  so easily accessible, Samui remains an idyllic island in the sun. Koh Samui is
  easily reached via an increasing number of direct international flights and
  over a dozen daily 1-hour flights from Bangkok. Arrive easily with a direct
  flight from any Asian hub on Bangkok Airways. Our award winning airport will
  receive you with a selection of shopping and eating options making flying in
  or out of Samui a breeze. If youвЂ™re traveling on a budget, and feeling
  brave, you can also reach the island via ferry from the mainland Thai city of
  Surat Thani. Be sure to check ferry times as the schedules are sometimes
  limited. Vikasa is just a fifteen minute drive from the Samui Airport. Airport
  pick-up is provided but not complementary for all guests, please for more
  information get in contact with us. https://vikasayoga.com/ Vikasa Yoga
