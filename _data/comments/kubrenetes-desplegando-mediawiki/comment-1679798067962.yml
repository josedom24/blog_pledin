message: "Borrowers who cannot repay a payday advance may face harassment from lenders, including repeated \r\nphone calls, emails, or perhaps visits with their home or workplace.\r\nBorrowers who will be considering a payday loan should be mindful of the potential influence \r\non their credit history and financial well-being, and really should \r\nonly borrow what they could afford to repay."
