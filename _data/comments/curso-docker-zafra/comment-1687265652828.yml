However, \r\nthink about this, what if you typed a catchier post title?\r\n\r\nI mean, I don't wish to tell you how to run your website, however \r\nwhat if you added something that grabbed people's attention? I mean Curso “Introducción a Docker” desarrollado para el CPR de Zafra - PLEDIN 3.0 is a \r\nlittle boring. You should glance at Yahoo's home page and see how they create news titles to get people to open the links.\r\n\r\nYou might try adding a video or a related pic or two to get \r\npeople interested about everything've got to say. In my opinion, it could bring your posts a little bit more interesting."
